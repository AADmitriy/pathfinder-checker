[Vpavlenko](https://github.com/pvlvld)'s code was employed to produce correct responses for certain examinations. Also, I was instructed about the rightness of specific test cases by him.

Snazarenko's code was employed for validating the accuracy of the produced responses. Additionally, he developed the path2 test.

[OAdamenko](https://github.com/OleksandraAdamenk0) identified files with incorrect formats and noted the absence of others.

[Rosinnii](https://github.com/Corkerro) identified a set of files that were unyielding to specific pathfinder implementations. Also, he taught me about the significant differences between LF and CRLF files.
